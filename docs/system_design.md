## Implementation approach

We will use Python's built-in libraries like 'curses' for console-based user interface. For data storage and tracking, we will use SQLite with 'sqlite3' package. For Hebrew language support, we will use 'python-bidi' package. We will implement a modular design with classes for User, Session, and Statistics. User class will handle user data and progress. Session class will handle the current typing session, including text generation and user input. Statistics class will handle data collection and presentation.

## Data structures and interface definitions


    classDiagram
        class User{
            +str username
            +str language
            +dict progress
            +__init__(username: str, language: str)
            +load_progress()
            +save_progress()
        }
        class Session{
            +str text
            +str input
            +User user
            +__init__(user: User)
            +generate_text(language: str)
            +get_input()
            +end_session()
        }
        class Statistics{
            +User user
            +dict data
            +__init__(user: User)
            +collect_data(session: Session)
            +display_data()
        }
        User "1" -- "1" Session: has
        User "1" -- "1" Statistics: has
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant M as Main
        participant U as User
        participant S as Session
        participant St as Statistics
        M->>U: create user
        M->>S: create session
        S->>U: load progress
        S->>S: generate text
        S->>S: get input
        S->>S: end session
        S->>U: save progress
        M->>St: create statistics
        St->>St: collect data
        St->>St: display data
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me. However, the specific design of the console interface and the structure of the SQLite database will need to be determined during the implementation phase.
