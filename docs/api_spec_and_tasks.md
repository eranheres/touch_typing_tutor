## Required Python third-party packages

- curses==2.2
- sqlite3==2.6.0
- python-bidi==0.4.2

## Required Other language third-party packages

- No third-party packages required in other languages.

## Full API spec

No API spec required as this is a console-based application.

## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Main entry point of the application. Creates User, Session, and Statistics objects. Calls methods to run the typing session and display statistics.']
- ['user.py', 'Contains User class. Handles user data and progress. Methods for loading and saving progress need to be implemented.']
- ['session.py', 'Contains Session class. Handles the current typing session. Methods for generating text, getting user input, and ending the session need to be implemented.']
- ['statistics.py', 'Contains Statistics class. Handles data collection and presentation. Methods for collecting data from a session and displaying data need to be implemented.']
- ['database.py', 'Handles interaction with the SQLite database. Methods for creating the database, querying data, and updating data need to be implemented.']

## Task list

- database.py
- user.py
- session.py
- statistics.py
- main.py

## Shared Knowledge

The 'curses' library is used for creating the console-based user interface. The 'sqlite3' package is used for data storage and tracking. The 'python-bidi' package is used for Hebrew language support. The application is designed in a modular way with classes for User, Session, and Statistics.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific design of the console interface and the structure of the SQLite database will need to be determined during the implementation phase.
